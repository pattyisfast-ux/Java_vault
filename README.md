This repo documents my  journey through Java — starting with `CSVCleaner.java`, a utility that trims messy CSV data and proves execution. Each file is a  receipt. Each commit is a  scene.

## Files
- `CSVCleaner.java`: Java code that cleans CSV lines by trimming extra spaces
- `input.csv`: Sample input data
- `cleaned.csv`: Output proof
- Screenshot: BlueJ execution receipt 

## How It Works
Run `CSVCleaner.java` in BlueJ with `input.csv` in the same folder. It creates `cleaned.csv` with trimmed lines.
